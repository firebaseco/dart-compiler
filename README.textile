h1. The Dart Compiler (as a Ruby Gem)

The *dart-compiler* gem is a svelte wrapper around the "Dart Compiler":http://www.dartlang.org/ (Dart to JavaScript compiler)

The Dart Compiler's *2011-10-12* JAR-files are included with the gem.

This wrapper is largelly based in "Closure Compiler":https://github.com/documentcloud/closure-compiler by DocumentCloud

h2. Installation

<pre>
sudo gem install dart-compiler
</pre>
  
h2. Usage

The @Dart::Compiler@ has a single method, @compile@, which can be passed a string or an open @IO@ object, and returns the compiled JavaScript. The result is returned as a string.

<pre>
require 'rubygems'
require 'dart-compiler'
Dart::Compiler.new.compile(File.open('hello.dart', 'r'))

=> "function native_ArrayFactory__new(typeToken, length) {......
</pre>
    
When creating a @Dart::Compiler@, you can pass any options that the command-line compiler accepts to the initializer and they'll be forwarded.


A @Dart::Error@ exception will be raised, explaining the Dart syntax error, if compilation fails for any reason.
